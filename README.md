# Music server in arduino IDE
 Server for ESP-32S.
 You can play a variety of musics when you add arrays to the `melodies` and `noteDurations`.
 When you make a http request to *localIpAdress*/music?music=*idx*, it's going to play the music with index *idx*.
 To work for you, you have to adjust your network in `ssid` and `password`!
